# first-test_deploy

This is a test deployment of an assignment from a coding boot camp I attended. 

It is a simple Register and Login Flask app that has some CRUD features using Python and MySQL. Not heavily invested in front-end , using bootstrap for styling.

This is also a test of updating a basic README.md file.

# Another Header added but through git clone command on VSCode.
This is another update to the README.md file that is simply to try out cloning a repo and making changes to it.
